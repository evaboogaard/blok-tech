# blok-tech

Hi :) Welcome to the code of the CMD "Project-Tech". For the duration of this project I will be creating a single interaction within a matching application. Feel free to look around or check out the [wiki](https://github.com/evaboogaard/blok-tech/wiki), which contains a lot of information about the process.

## 🎨 Description
This is a mobile application for artists of different disciplines to find each other and work together. Making money in the creative field is difficult - but gets a lot easier if you work together. A graphic designer can be incredibly useful for an artist that created sculptures; a violin player might need a painter to put the music into visuals; or a web designer can create something beautiful for a make-up artist that just can't get their work out there.
